MATH FUN GAME - IMPROVEMENT TODO LIST
=====================================

RECENT UPDATES (2025-11-15)
---------------------------
✓ Implemented difficulty-based timer mechanics:
  - Easy: 30s start, +5s per correct answer
  - Medium: 60s start, +10s per correct answer  
  - Hard: 120s start, +30s per correct answer
✓ Added custom CSS tooltips to all stat icons with explanations
